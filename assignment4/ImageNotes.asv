% Images in Matlab

% Main Types
% Raster format - rectangular grid of pixels, problems on resizing
% (resolution dependent)
% Data in raster format describes the characteristics of each pixel
% JPEG, PNG, TIFF
% Most common and often used to display images on the internet
% Vector format - geometric description of each point for smooth resizing
% (resolution independent). Eventually must be put into raster format to
% dispay on digital screen (after resizing and redrawn)
% SVG

% Image File Contents
% Pixels:
% - Smallest element of an image
% - Can only correspond to any one value (intensity of light photons
% striking that point)
% - Total number of pixels defined as the number of pixels in an area
% (length x width)
% - Pixel density is a measure for resolution on screens (pixels per inch)

% Bits Per Pixel
% Number of different colors in an image depends on bits per pixel (also
% called depth of color)

% Image File Contents
% FIle Sizes
% - Image files are large hecause they contain a lot of information

% Color Codes
% Colors are represented using different models
% - Decimal code (0,0,0) = Black, (255,255,255) = White, Gray = half of 255
% x 3
% RGB code: uses the amounts of the primary color in each decimal notation
